### Example Exercise 3.2.3

Assume a is a multiple of b and b is a multiple of c. Then b can be rewritten as a multiplied by k integer. If b is a multiple of c and b can be rewritten in terms of a and k. Therefore a is a multiple of c. 

### 2.4
    We will prove the contrapositive. Let n and k are an arbitrary integer. Assume n is not even and k is the amount of times 2 can be fully divided into n. Then n can be represented as (2k+1). Squaring this results in $4k^2 + 4k + 1$, which can be rewritten as $2(2k^2+2k)+ 1$.$2(2k^2+2k)$ is even meaning adding by one makes it odd, therefore $n^2$ when odd is not a even number.

### 2.5
    We will prove the contrapositive. Assume that a and b are even (negation of a or b is a and b). If both a and b are even a and b can be represented by the following 2k + 2j. Simplifying even more results in 2(k+j) therefore the summation of a and b when both are even results in a even number.
### 2.8
    Suppose not. Then there are integers x and y such that $x^2= 4y+2 = 2(2y+1)$. Therefore x^2 and x are even so x= 2k. $4k^2 = 2(y+1)$ transforms into $2k^2 = y+1$. $2k^2$ is even but 2y+1 is odd.This is a contradiction so there are no integers x and y that $x^2=4y+2$

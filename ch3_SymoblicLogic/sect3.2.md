### Example Exercise 3.2.3

Assume a is a multiple of b and b is a multiple of c. Then b can be rewritten as a multiplied by k integer. If b is a multiple of c and b can be rewritten in terms of a and k. Therefore a is a multiple of c. 

### 2.4
    We will prove the contrapositive. Let n and k are an arbitrary integer. Assume n is not even and k is the amount of times 2 can be fully divided into n. Then n can be represented as (2k+1). Squaring this results in $4k^2 + 4k + 1$, which can be rewritten as $2(2k^2+2k)+ 1$.$2(2k^2+2k)$ is even meaning adding by one makes it odd, therefore $n^2$ when odd is not a even number.

### 2.5
    We will prove the contrapositive. Assume that a and b are even (negation of a or b is a and b). If both a and b are even a and b can be represented by the following 2k + 2j. Simplifying even more results in 2(k+j) therefore the summation of a and b when both are even results in a even number.
### 2.8
    Suppose not. Then there are integers x and y such that $x^2= 4y+2 = 2(2y+1)$. Therefore x^2 and x are even so x= 2k. $4k^2 = 2(y+1)$ transforms into $2k^2 = y+1$. $2k^2$ is even but 2y+1 is odd.This is a contradiction so there are no integers x and y that $x^2=4y+2$

### Practice Problems

### 1
    P represents if a + b is even and Q represents a being even and R represents b being even. 
$$P \implies (Q \vee R)$$
The contrapositive of this statement is for all integers a and b, if a or b are odd then a + b is odd.
$ \neg Q \wedge \neg R \implies \neg P$ 

The converse of this statement is for all integers a and b if a and b are even then a+b is even.
$$ Q \wedge R \implies P$$

The negation of this statement is for some integers a and b, if a + b are even then a and b are odd

It is false as a and b can be two odd numbers, which will result in a even number if you add them. Therefore a+b being an even number doesn't mean that a and b are both even.

The contrapostive of this statement is also false as both a and b can be odd resulting in a a even number if you add them. Moreover, contrapositives are logically equivalent so it would not be true.

Assume a and b are even integers. Then a can be rewritten as 2k and b as 2j. Adding the two results in the following 2k+2j which can be rewritten as 2(k+j). We know that k and j are integers as a and b are both even, therefore the converse of the statement is true.

The negation is true as it states for some integers not stating that all a + b have a and b being odd.

### 3

Direct proof:
Assume n is an even integer. Then n can be rewritten as 2k for some integer as k. Now if we put this into 8n it results into 16k, which can be simplified into 2(8k). Therefore if n is even then 8n will also be even. 

The converse of this statement is for some integers n if 8n is even then n is even. This is not true as if 8n is 40 then n would be 5, which is odd.  
### 4
Proof by contradiction. Assume for the sake of contradiction that we every time we roll we land on a number that has appeared less (or an equal amount) than all other numbers from 1 to 6. By the time we roll 36 dice we would have rolled all numbers from 1 to 6, six times. The next roll would result in a number appearing 7 times regardless of what number it is. This is a contradiction, so there are 7 dice that land on the same number.

Suppose you roll 10 dice without any four matching rolls. This means that all rolls would be from 3 numbers to a max of 3 numbers, which is only 9 dice. Therefore there must be 4 different values as if there isn't any 4 matching rolls the max amount of dice is 9.

### 5

Case 1: n is even. Then n = 2k for some integer k. Thus
$$ 3n = 3(2k) $$
$$ 3n = 2(3k) $$
2(3k) is an even integer, therefore 3n is even.

Case 2: Proof by contrapositive. Assume n is odd integer, thus n can be expressed as 2k+1 for some integer k. Then 3n = 3(2k+1) for some integer k. Thus
$$ 3n = 3(2k+1) $$
$$ 3n = (6k+3) $$
6k+3 is an odd integer, therefore through contrapositive when 3n is even, n is also even.

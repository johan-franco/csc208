## Example 4.1.7.
We can think of each mathmetician as a seperate vertice. The questions asks if it is possible for each mathmetician to have shaken their hands with exatly 7 people. This means that the degree sequence would be (7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7), which is a total of 63. The Handshake Lemma states that the sum of all degrees of vertices should be even therefore, this is impossible.

## 1.
If each person is shaking hands with eachother and there are 10 people, this represents a complete graph of 10 vertices. Moreover, as a handshake is an event that occurs with two people (and then counts as one) it represents a edge. With this in mind, we can apply Handshake Lemma to find the amount of handshakes and as it is a complete graph each person (vertex) has a degree of 9. This means adding them all is 90, which when divided by two is 45, therefore there have been 45 handshakes. 

In relation to graph theory, this question is related to significantly given what I said previously. Each person exchanging handshakes with all other people makes the problem a complete graph as each person is representative as a vertice and each handshake as a edge.

## 2.
Every person represents a vertice and as being friends with someone is something that involves 2 people (and not counted twice) it represents a edge. Therefore the degree of everyone should be 2 meaning the sum of them all is 10 and as it is even it is possible as the sum of every degree needs to be even.

With 3 people in the group this would mean that the sum of the degrees is 15. This is impossible as the edges should be half of the sum of degrees and you cannot have .5 of a edge.

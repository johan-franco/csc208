## 1
Subtracting by 1 results in the numbers all being squares. Since the first term is $a_1$ we can conclude the closed formula is $n^2+1$. 

Adding all the numbers results in the numbers being all triangular numbers. Subsequently this means the closed formula is $ T_n -1$

Subtracting the sequence by two again results in triangular numbers. Therefore, the closed formula is $T_n +2$.

We find factorials after adding by one to each term (with 2 as inital term), resulting in $(n+1)!-1

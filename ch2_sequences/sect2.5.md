If you have a an amount of beans that end with 5 by night they will double and end with a 0. However, by the time you wake up you will eat 5, effectively meaning that at noon you will have an amount of beans ending in 5.

This does not mean that you will always have an amount ending in 5 as you need to start with 5 beans first.

 Let P(n) be the statement $7^n $ is a multiple of 6. We will show 
 P(n) is true for all $n \in \N$
 Firstly the base case P(1) is $7^1 -1$ is a multiple of 6 since this simplifies into 6 and 6 is a multiple of 6 P(1) true.

 If we assume P(k) is a value where k is $k \in \N$ then $7^k -1$ is a multiple of 6 therefore equal to 6j. Now if we consider k+1 this means that $7^{k+1}-1$ if we represent these values differently results in $7(7^k - 1)+6$, based on our previous statement this can be simplified into 7*(6j) +  6 which is further simplified into 6(7j+1). Therefore by the principle of mathematical induction P(n) is true for all $n \in \N$.

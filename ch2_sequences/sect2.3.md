## Example 2.3.2.

The first difference results in 4,7,10 which is a arthmetic sequence with a closed formula of 3n+1 and can be further simplified into 3,3,3. Meaning this will have a degree 2 polynomial. Using this we can plug values into, $an^2 +bn+c$. Which results in two linear problems with two unknowns that we can substitution or elimination on. $1 = a + b$ & $7=a4+b2+2$s. This simplifies into a = 3/2 and b = -1/2. This method only works because we know that this sequence is a finite difference.

## Example 2.3.4.
The first one can't be described by a polynomial as it returns the same sequence. 

The second one first difference is 7,43,133,301,571 then, 36, 90, 168, 270, the third difference is 54,78,102 finally, 24,24 thus it is a polynomial of the fourth degree

The third changes but it changes as you take its differences but eventually returns to the same sequence.

## 1

$0,2,6,12,20$ if we take difference returns, $2,4,6,8$. Continuing further returns, $2,2,2$. Thus it is a second degree polynomial that can be described by this formula, $an^2 +bn+c$
Plugging numbers results in the following linear equations, $2 = a + b$ and $6 = 4a+2b$. Using elimination results in $6 = 4a + 2(2-a)$ this simplifies into $ a =1$ and if a=1 then b=1 so the formula is $n^2+n$

## 2
$1,2,4,8,15,26 $if we take the difference returns, $1,2,4,7,11$ continuing, $1,2,3,4,$ finally returning, $1,1,1$. Thus this is a polynomial of third degree. Plugging numbers results in the following equations, $1 = a+b+c$, $3 = 8a+4b+2c$ and $7 = 27a + 9b+ 3a$. Using elimination and subsititution results in $1/6n^3 + 5/6n + 1$

## 6
I know this sequence is quadratic because I can take two diffrences (2,4,6,8 & 2,2,2) and it will result in a sequence that is all constant. I can guess the correct formula through comparison to the sequence of squares through realizing the difference between values of these two sequences is n + 1. 16 and 13 are both the fourth term of their sequence and have a difference of 3, 7 and 9 have a difference of two and a third term. Therefore I can reasonably guess the formula is $n^2 -n +1$.

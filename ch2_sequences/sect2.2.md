### Part A
The recursive definition is $a_n = a_{n-1} + 4$ with $a_1 = 5$

### Part B
Closed formula is $a_n = 4(n - 1) + 5$ through I believe it could also be expressed as $a_n = 4n+1$, this is a arthmetic sequence meaning its closed formula mirrors a linear equtaion (y = mx+b).

### Part C
We can plug 2013 into our closed formula and solve for n to check if 2013 is part of the sequence (n would have to be a whole number). This results in $2008 = 4(n-1)$, $2008/4 = n-1$, $n = 503$ Therefore, 231 is in our sequence.

### Part D
We can check how many term are in the sequence through using the closed formula again as the sequence follows the same rules and contain same values. $533 = 4(n-1)+5$, $528 = 4(n-1)$, $n-1 = 132$, $n = 133$. Therefore the amount of terms in the arthmetic sequence is 133.
### Part E
To find the sum between the arthmetic sequence we can essentially regroup them to faciliate adding. First we add the first and last term $ 5 + 533 = 538$. Next we need to know the amount of terms inbetween the last and first, which we do through pluggin in our closed formula, which results in us finding out that 533 is the 133 term. We multiply 538 by 133 and then divide by two, $\frac{538*133}{2}$. This is equivalent to 35777.
### Part F

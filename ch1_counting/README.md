# Chapter 1 (counting) Notes:

## .1

- Additive Principle states that if two event (A, B) occur in unrelated/disjoint (disjoin meaning that these two events can't occur at the same time) ways then the events of A and B can occur in a + b ways.
- The multiplicative principle states that if event A can occur in m
ways, and each possibility for A allows for exactly n ways for event
B, then the event “A and B” can occur in m · n ways. In other words if the choices aren't disjoint use the multiplicative principle.
- The word 'and' does not mean multiplication, there are cases were an event can change the next preceding event (which wouldn't make it a simple multiplicative problem)

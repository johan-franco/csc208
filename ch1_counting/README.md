- Additive Principle states that if two event (A, B) occur in unrelated/disjoint (disjoin meaning that these two events can't occur at the same time) ways then the events of A and B can occur in a + b ways.
- The multiplicative principle states that if event A can occur in m
ways, and each possibility for A allows for exactly n ways for event
B, then the event “A and B” can occur in m · n ways. In other words if the choices aren't disjoint use the multiplicative principle.
- The word 'and' does not mean multiplication, there are cases were an event can change the next preceding event (which wouldn't make it a simple multiplicative problem)
- The additive principle with sets that have no common elements is |A ∪ B| = |A| + |B| .
- The Cartesian Product is the following: A × B = {(x, y) : x ∈ A ∧ y ∈ B}. In it x is a element of A and y is a element of B. The result of finding the cartesian product should be a set of ordered pairs.
- Multiplicative Principle with sets is defined as the following: Given two sets A and B, we have |A × B|  |A| · |B|.
- This is the cardinality of two sets: |A ∪ B| = |A| + |B| − |A ∩ B| (It does not matter if both sets share values as we subtract the duplicated values in the calculation)
- Cardinality for three sets: |A ∪ B ∪ C| = |A|+|B|+|C|−|A ∩ B|−|A ∩ C|−|B ∩ C|+|A ∩ B ∩ C| .

## 1

The answer is 5 * 3 * 17, which is 255. This was calculated using the multiplicative principle, which can be used as when you choose a shirt you still have to choose 1 of your three pants and 17 bowties.

A) Assuming you have to only wear one then you have 8 different options for neck-wear (as you cannot choose another).

B) If you must wear one of both then you have 3*5 options, which is 15.

C) We have the orginal 15 options (3 * 5), and the shirts are chosen with either a skirt or pants meaning the choices is added by 5(shirts) * 7(skirts and pants added). Additionally, you can simply wear a dress which would not need a shirt or pant. Therefore the equation should be the following 5 * 7 + 7 = 42 outfits.

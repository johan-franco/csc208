## 1 
There are $2^6 = 64$ subsets as each element is either added or not to a subset (yes or no). By limiting the amount of elements in the subset results in the amount of subsequent subsets turning into $2^3 = 8$. The subsets that do contain any odd numbers is the total amount of subsets subtracted by the subsets with only even numbers, resulting in $2^6 - 2^3= 56$. 

## 2
There are 15 sets with a cardinality of 4, I found this through multiplying $6*5*4*3$ and then dividing by $4*3*2*1$. There are 3 different subsets with cardinality of four that contain 2,3 and 5 meaning there is only 3 subsets with a cardinality of 4 that could have a subset of {2,3,5}. There are 3 even and odd numbers meaning it is impossible to avoid either at least one even or odd number. As there can only be 4 elements and there are 3 distinct even numbers, the subsets with cardinality of 4 that contain one even number are 3.

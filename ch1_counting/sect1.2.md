There are $2^6 = 64$ subsets as each element is either added or not to a subset (yes or no). By limiting the amount of elements in the subset results in the amount of subsequent subsets turning into $2^3 = 8$. The subsets that do contain any odd numbers is the total amount of subsets subtracted by the subsets with only even numbers, resulting in $2^6 - 2^3= 56$.
